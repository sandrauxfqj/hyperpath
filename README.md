# HyperPath

## Overview

HyperPath is a Python program designed to enhance security protocols for Windows access by implementing robust authentication and encryption methods. This software ensures that sensitive information is securely handled and accessed only by authorized users.

## Features

- **Password Hashing**: Uses SHA-256 to securely hash user passwords.
- **Data Encryption**: Utilizes Fernet symmetric encryption to secure sensitive data.
- **User Authentication**: Compares hashed passwords to authenticate users and grant or deny access.
- **Secure Key Generation**: Generates a secure encryption key for data protection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hyperpath.git
    cd hyperpath
    ```

2. Install the required library:
    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python hyperpath.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to set a password, encrypt data, and authenticate user access.

## Security Notice

- Ensure that the encryption key is stored securely and not exposed to unauthorized users.
- Regularly update the cryptography library to protect against vulnerabilities.
